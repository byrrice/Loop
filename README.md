# Loop
## Videogame Project

This is the repository created for our EECS 290 game Loop group project. I aimed to finish polishing it up, but have since abandoned it
due to the numerous bugs (Can't play the levels, so many imported assets that we don't need, etc). The demo is playable at the website linked above.
